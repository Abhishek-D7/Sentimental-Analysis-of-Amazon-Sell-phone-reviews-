You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?",1.0

Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway?

Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.)

The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.",5.0

It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.,1.0

It has not been treated lightly (I recently opened up the back to find the serial #, and found it full of dirt & dust). It has crashed with me skiing, been splashed with salt water while sailing, and been drenched in sweat while in my bike jersey. Still, it works.

My battery has NEVER run out on me. EVER! And I am super-negligent when it comes to charging it. Of course, the phone really only has normal calling and basic texting.

I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight.",

On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow.

After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with?

I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place. Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad). I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original. I will keep my new every 2 discount until Verizon comes out with a very good Android or Apple finally relents with the iphone/At&T exclusivity.",4.0

Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon.

I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page. Pros: I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus. The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time. The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails. It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will. The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures. The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode. It's easy to use. Sound quality is good. Nice long life of battery charge. Cons: The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change. Some functions are difficult to find on the menus. That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu. The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring. There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone. (ETA: Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light. Duh.)

I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.",10.0

What can I say? This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It's not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn't the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I'm rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn't for everyone; it has none of the smartphone ""flair"" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn't lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.",36.0

We looked on Verizon.com and everywhere on the internet, but she could not find a phone like her pink Motorola RAZR phone. My sweetheart wanted a pink RAZR phone just like the one she had. This product filled the bill exactly. It is the spitting image of her old phone and every feature works great.

Stability issues within months,"Purchased used - this review is not about the phone in particular, but in the one received from the seller. Additionally, due to time constraints I did not attempt to take advantage of any guarantees. Purchased for my wife - she was sick of her smartphone and wanted to go back to the past. It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use ""genuine"" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn't have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than. Several factory resets and hours later it was stable again, but only temporarily... Pretty sure we got a lemon. It is now in the trash.

This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone's extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they're selling isn't suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem.

Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off.

This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for ""Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..""). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon's tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum). I am not affiliated with anyone. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word's spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon's review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in silver). Any similarities between this review and any other review that I have written is due to the fact that the problem that I detail in this review directly affects over 50 different phone models, not just the one I bought.

Well this first thing I found was that the belt clip kept coming off my belt and the phone kept landing on hard floors, etc. The second thing I know the outside screen (thin plastic) is cracked. Verizon wants a minimum of $189 to replace it with a used phone (unless I'd purchased insurance). Phone repair places can't get parts to repair it. Of course this eliminates the waterproofing feature, since water can likely get in the 2 cracks on the screen. I don't mind the cracks themselves since I don't really use the outside screen. Third happening was when the holder that wraps around the phone started coming off and letting the phone fall out. That's when I discarded the belt clip/holder and started carrying the phone in my pocket. I've decided I was actually better off with the old phone.

Either that or Verizon is just full of idiots (entirely possible.) When I activated the phone online, with the aid of Verizon live chat service, it made me dial a number and then required me to purchase minutes. I have read other reviewers say that Verizon would not/could not activate their phone on the prepaid network. I'm not sure what's going on but I'm pretty irritated. I like the phone, alot for the use I've gotten out of it so far (very little), but the whole reason I ditched my smartphone was because I was sick of all the complicated BS. P.S. If anyone could help me figure out what's going on here I'd appreciate it. EDIT: Apparently me and Verizon were both being idiots. I have it active and working as it should now. The phone itself is wonderful. Since I still have a data plan I can get all kinds of cute little arcade games and apps. Simple things of course but I'm a simple lady. It's a pretty sturdy phone, it's lightweight and feels like it might be made of cheap material but it's designed in a way to take a fall. One reason smartphones break so easily is because they are square and flat. This thing is rounded on any angle. The 'closed' screen is flat but it is slightly inlayed in the phone so if you do drop it directly on that surface it will hit the plastic edges of the phone and not the screen. The backplate isn't sealing as tightly as it should, which probably does not make it waterproof ""up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes"" but I think that might have been my fault by trying to improperly open the backplate. The keypad is silicone or something and has no gaps. With the backplate properly sealed I'm sure it is waterproof. Christmas came early lol I'm happy with this little guy. Oh and no more charging my phone twice a day. I haven't charged it since I got it a week ago and despite use in almost every possible way it didn't get down to one battery bar until today.

I called Verizon Customer Service to make the change from my old phone, quick and easy, although I had to re-enter all my contacts manually. I imagine that going to a Verizon store might allow you to automatically transfer all your contacts. Overall, an excellent choice for a basic phone.",

I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount.

After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the ""wrong battery"", ""unsupported battery"", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn't arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they'd mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and ""*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired."" and in a separate email, ""Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST."" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by ""We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST"". A week later, I got another message, ""Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing"", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA.

My wants are simply, good phone service, big screen, one button speed dial, answer by opening lid and again, TOUGH ! Have had the phone two months and with an easy modification am very pleased with the phone. Read a lot of reviews and the most common complaint was the PTT feature being turned on often. Yes I found this to be a real pain, often having to press buttons to tell the phone I didn't want to enable the service. After waiting the 30 day return period I fixed that issue. Took a razor blade and carefully scrapped the case around the PTT button, then around the button. This was done to get good adhesion for step two, superglue. I carefully put a heavy bead of superglue around the PTT button. PTT hasn't activated in over a month, now I'm happy with the phone.",

The included software to sync to my PC does not work, nor do any newer versions downloaded from Samsung. There is no support through Samsung for their software that I can find. The soft keys are programmable and I have made them match my old tundra. That is a real plus. I have read a lot of complaints about inability to disable PTT but I don't think it can be disabled on the tundra either. There is no option to disable the data keys. The Tundra allowed locking the browser and other data usage so there were no inadvertent connections.

They were simply offloading what should have been landfill. 2. I asked, then, what would be a no-frills model that was as rugged as Old Nokia.

It seems like it is so until you start endlessly having to decline adding services. He doesn't necessarily want Push To Talk but EVERY TIME he answers the Rugby his finger rests on the PTT button and he first has to decline adding that feature before he can answer. The only way to disable it is to physically damage the button so it will not activate. The large center button is of course a browser launch shortcut which he hit's all the time. Was there not a class action about data use entrapment? There should be another. There is a GPS button which is easy for a senior to hit that also launches a service he does not want and cannot be disabled. The menu is a further fleece attempt festooned with AT&T services he doesn't want or need. Were we not stuck with AT&T due to location this would certainly have been the final straw.

I have spent more than 20 hours on the phone talking with several different Samsung technical people and they couldn't help me find any way to connect the Samsung SGH-A847 Rugby II to any type of PC. I have three computers, one an HP desktop with Windows 7 64 bit, the other an HP desktop with Windows Vista 32 bit, the third one a laptop with Windows Vista 32 bit. For hours on end I followed the detailed instructions of Samsung Support technicians and to no avail. The phone is detected by the computer (the computer makes a sound and there is for a moment a bar in the Samsung New PC Studio software), but that's it. I purchased and added a memory card to use the 'mass storage' function, hoping this will give me some kind of connectivity, but it didn't work either. Furthermore, and this is very unfortunate to the users, the Samsung ""New PC Studio"" software has not been licensed and approved by Microsoft and the software is labeled by all Windows computers as a dangerous program that will harm your computer when you are in the process of installing it. Of course this is not true, (Norton Antivirus says the program is safe) but right now the problem is that Windows computers are labeling the Samsung software as dangerous and harmful when it is not and probably affecting its functionality. The Samsung ""New PC Studio"" is the software that is supposed to let you communicate your phone with your computer. The program loads and works but will not 'sync' with the Samsung SGH-A847 phone or connect to it, no matter how hard you try or how many tricks you pursue. Every time you get the message that there are no devices connected. In today's world, an 'advanced' cellular phone that is not recognized by any computer and will not 'sync' or connect with the computer no matter what you try or do, is simply not acceptable. There are also no updates or upgrades to the phone software available yet. I have also called AT&T and they don't know anything at all about this problem or care at all about it. They believe is a Samsung problem and not their problem to resolve. It is a total shame, because apart from this serious problem, that is still unresolved by Samsung, the phone is an average phone that works.",

Honestly, this obsession started to ruin my life and I'm not even exagerating. I removed the memory card because I thought that might have something to do with it...nope. I cleaned the terminals making contact with the battery...nope. I reset the phone, thereby erasing all of my data and contact information...nope. I didn't swap out the battery because the phone wasn't that old. Eventually, one day, whilst hanging a ceiling fan in my house, the phone rang, which was remarkable given the aforementioned. This was a particularly tense moment of the installation - the moment when you've just finished mating the wires and are holding the motor in place while you screw it in to the ceiling-mounted anchor. As my thumb wedged between the keypad and the screen to flip it open, it turned off. I lost it. I threw the phone into the wall and it shattered into pieces. The phone is no longer a problem now.

Why I picked this out was because it's a flip phone. . . those who have had open faced phones know how they tend to dial unexpectedly! The phone's camera does quite well (standard quality though), although most do nowadays. One of my favorite features about this phone is the customization with the menu. It allows you to customize the shortcuts and also you get to pick out your four top menu options (ex. text, pics, video etc. . . you choose) My last camera was a motorolla razr and found that this is a much tougher phone with the look and feel. It's not the fanciest but it will do all you need for your phone needs (and you're not required to sign up on a service contract for internet etc.) The only features I would say this phone lags in is the speaker. It's not too bad but it can be somewhat blurry on phone conversations, almost like you are hearing someone talk through a pillow (but does not occur too frequently, not really an issue). The other is that there are some buttons somewhere that get pushed while the phone is in my pocket, the camera takes pictures and when you go through your picture folder you see a whole load of black pictures (from being in your pocket). But it is a great phone overall, it is solid enough for me, has a decent features and does very well for a phone that isn't a 'smart phone'.",

I had the first one for two days before the battery quit holding a charge for longer than a few hours. I would charge it all night, but by the next afternoon, the battery was running out of power. Now, this problem occurred even if I did not actually use the phone, and no applications were left running either. So I swapped that phone for a second one, and it lasted about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. I phoned ATT customer service each time to document the problem and asked if there were any issues being tracked for these phones. The polite staff there told me that there were no issues, so I asked that my report be logged, and I asked for a replacement battery. ATT shipped the new replacement battery, and this one worked great. . . for about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. So the phone ended up being plugged into its charger for many hours each day and night, but, when this phone is charging, you cannot receive incoming calls. Why Samsung did not consider that drawback a huge problem is puzzling, confounding, and unforgivable. Combine that issue with the irritating ""push to talk"" button which is nearly impossible to avoid, and the net result is a high frustration factor. I can understand now why these phone are supposedly rugged and shockproof. The urge to hurl the Rugby II against the closest hard surface can be hard to check. I managed to ditch this clunker just before my 30-day trial period ended. Let me say, it has been a trial, too.

Oh, it still functioned as a phone just fine, but I had to keep a standby battery charged up to swap out, the radio feature never seemed to work well with their idiotic connection system, and most importantly my friends were posting photos on Facebook that they took with their cel telephones, without having to lug around a camera, and I wanted to get in on that. So, after looking at several phones at the Verizon store, I decided on the Samsung Gusto. What a mistake. For one, the tech at the store was unable to simply copy my old phone book from the old phone to the new one. I had to manually enter every single name and number from my list. Hundreds of contacts. For another, the camera ""feature"" in this phone is useless. Oh, it snaps the pictures just fine, and there are even a reasonable number of creative options available for the adequate 640x480 images. The problem is they are impossible to download off of the camera to view, edit or post. You can supposedly send them from the phone to a website to view them. But after spending over an hour setting up the account and website, I found that it just doesn't work. The obvious method, which would be to connect the phone to the USB port on your computer-won't work either. Evidently this is because this goofy knick-knack has some sort of cheesy proprietary software that is INCOMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, which also explains why the phone book was untransferable. The salesman at the Verizon store didn't even know this, and Samsung doesn't point this out, either. You can look at the pictures on the phone's screen. That's it. So, don't waste your money expecting this to be anything more than a telephone. It works just fine as a telephone-but that's it.",

It was basically free with the purchase of a 30 day/750 minute phone card. I also got the universal accessories kit free. I have used this phone for a month. Last week I dropped it on a hard floor. After putting the battery and cover back on it the phone has shown no damage or problems. It appears to be durable and still works very well. Three things make an impression on me. 1) This phone is small. Not clunky. 2) Signal reception is great. No dropped calls yet! 3) The quality. I expected that a free phone in this price range would be loose or cheaply built. This phone is much better than that. The other surprise was the universal accessory kit which usually goes for around $15. It came free with a promotion code that I used during the purchase. The phone pouch is durable and the attachments are quality items. Everything works including the car charger. If you read the fine print on the Net10 website they normally send the phones with a battery and a home/wall charger. Net10 service is dependable and the phone cards can cost as little as 3 cents/minute up to the 10 cents/minute standard cards available in stores. I did call Net10 customer support to verify my order and out of curiosity about their service. What I found was that the initial response wasn't very good but I was passed off to another service tech who answered my questions quickly. This may be an instance where it depends on the particular tech that answers your call. But I did get an efficient human response to my call. Reloading minutes is easy and hassle-free also.

Beforehand, I owned the Motorola flip phone, under Net10. Paid $30 for that, it was great as a starter for my first cell phone, paid for by myself. When my mom was paying my bill, I had the LG900G and it was great, loved the feel, the keyboard, all the little gadgets; absolutely awesome. I decided to shop around for an upgrade, something a little more my speed than a flip phone. After seeing this phone, I read all the reviews because I wanted to make sure I was getting the bang for my buck, even if it was only $10 ($16 & change because of shipping) and I decided that between this and the Net10 with the slide up keyboard, that this phone was the better deal. I've had it for two days now, transferring my number took five minutes online and then another 10-15 minutes with the phone physically. Quick, easy, and done in less than a half hour. I love the feel of the keys (I have tiny hands, so it works well with me) and it can do a lot for the price. Bought a case too, which should arrive to my house today, which I also paid $10 ($5 for the case, $4.95 shipping.) In total, I bought a brand new phone and a brand new case for $26.91, under the price I paid for the flip phone without a case ($30) and I'm very satisfied so far.

Things like a dedicated camera button, a cover for the USB charging port to avoid dust getting in and a standard headset jack. The menu is very basic, nothing out of the ordinary, easy to read. As far as the network goes, I did some research and after activating this phone I am certain the networks got switched from T-Mobile to Verizon Wireless coverage. This phone runs on Verizon's CDMA 1X network. Which is also a big plus for me because I have better signal and I'm saving $5 with Net10 over Verizon's Unlimited for basic phones plan.

I bought this as a cheap efficient way to make and receive important calls. Unfortunately it’s never worked. Out of the box, the phone proved incapable of keeping a charge longer than one day. What’s more is that after a painstaking activation; I say this because after registering the product on Net 10’s website the phone still didn’t work. I had to call Net 10 from a land line so that a customer service representative could walk me through the process of putting in about 8 to 10 activation codes. After this, the phone couldn’t receive a signal… almost anywhere. In a very few locations we were able to make calls, but nowhere that it actually counted. It wouldn’t even work at our home whereas we’ve had AT&T and Verizon phones which work just fine. After calling Net 10 again, the customer service representative deduced that the produce was defective and that they would send a new phone. I was fine with this even putting aside that we’d had the produce well over a month and never got to use it. After repeating the home address to the representative three times, he still got it wrong. The package ended up at a FedEx several miles away and they couldn’t resend the package. So, I called Net 10 yet again to explain the problem to them. They said that they’d send another phone and never did. Instead they cancelled my service with them which is just fine as I would’ve done that anyway. The bottom line is that I gave this item three stars out of grace. I assume that if you get a working product there will be no problem, but be forewarned that costumer service is terrible should you have an actual problem.",

In the Web design world, there is a general rule that a user should never have to click more than twice to get to any page on a site. The developer of this phone certainly did not have that rule in mind. I may be missing it, but I have not been able to find a speaker function on this phone. That means I can't drive while using it (no Bluetooth feature either) and I can't use the speaker when I am typing and making business calls. The phone often has to be reset because the clock stops or the date is wrong. The keyboard is also kind of weird. I thought you could use the shift button to switch from letters to numbers, but you can't. You have to click 123/sym, write out the number, and then go back to Abc/abc to write the rest of a message.

This is not an Android phone, if it's speed you want, buy an android, if it's just a basic Talk and text phone, then this is the type of phone to buy. This phone is a CDMA phone, it doesn't have a SIM card in it. I have read in an online forum that this phone actually uses the Verizon Towers so the signal is carried by them. I have had no signal problems thus far with this phone no matter where I have been in my area, though there are different factors that can come into play when it comes to cellphone signal strengths and weakness's.

Also, there is now way of deactivating the browser that I am aware of and believe me I've looked for one. The browser is a one button push, and the only defense from doing this is to lock the keyboard by holding down the space button, which I forget to do sometimes. I just learned you can set the phone to lock the keyboard after a time of inactivity, in case you forget to lock it like I do. I was skeptical that this phone only charged you .25 minutes a text that another reviewer mentioned but sure enough it does, although I just noticed it also charges you 1 minute a call whether the person you are calling answers or not, which to the best of my knowledge doesn't happen with other net 10 phones. The mp3 player is a nice feature and can use up to 16 GB of ...which is quite a lot of music. Can't comment too much about the camera save for the fact you cannot zoom in after you snap a photo.

You definitely can check email and news, sports, whatever you want. It is slow, though, and not a computer experience. But it does work and you can indeed get your Internet fix if you have to.

But their phones don't work in buildings, elevators, on the subway, etc., and mine does. It seems that Net10 rents working wireless access from expensive companies and then sells it to us. I have purchased 3 of these phones. One was defective enough to return it, and a second one refuses to go into autolock mode, so I often find it browsing the net or writing its own text messages. To my knowledge it has never actually butt-dialed anyone. I can lock it by just holding down the spacebar, but I often forget. It has never managed to use up my minutes, anyway. A fourth Net10 phone also died before I started with these Samsungs. So why do I give them 5 stars? Because they are practically giving these phones away, and the per month charge is reasonable by US standards.The only reason I don't get yet another phone and dump my slightly defective one is that I'll have to type in about 300 digits to reprogram the new phone to take over my account.

I just need to make calls and send text in these areas and in late 2014 signal strength is always better than GSM. Battery life is 7 days with light to Moderate use. A very good rural area phone.,

The mp3 player is above average sound quality. 3.5 headphone jack. Easy to lock keyboard by pressing space bar. Only thing I would change is the keys are a bit small but you get used to them. All in all, if you don't want to pay 80 or 90 bucks for a ""supposedly"" better phone with these features, this is the phone for you. I like it a lot. Have 2 of them. One for straight talk and the other for net 10. One more thing, this phone has the most economical texting plan, it's only 0.25 min per text. Other phones it's 0.50.

Features: 1.3Mega Pixel camera, Long battery life, Quarty Keyboard My impressions: Keys are small but easy to type on, this phone does not support T9 word and calling numbers is slightly more annoying since the keys are smaller then most are used to. I can't comment on the browser features since for some reason the phone is roaming in the Wyoming area where I am located and it says data restriction 36 but from videos the browser is nothing special. It is also worth mentioning that you can record your own ringtones and transfer audio and images back and forth from your computer via a data cable or blue tooth adapter. Picture quality is better then my old 1.3MP camera which was a scoop but it's still nothing amazing, I'm sure everyone has seen what most cell phone pictures are like, and this phone is no exception, but still it is nice to have the feature. Also you can lock the keypad by pressing and holding the spacebar down. Features aren't great but you can get around 300 minutes or about 1200 text for 20$ per month on this phone which is very cheap for those of us who don't talk much.",71.0

Sharp,5,"January 23, 2013",True,Really impressed with the phone and Windows 7.5,"I ordered the Samsung Focus I917 unlocked phone because the price was good and I wanted to test out Windows 7 OS. My carrier is Consumer Cellular and a 2nd sim card from them was free plus adding the phone to my account is just 10 dollars a month. I received the card and phone on the same day, inserted the card and voila, I was making calls. Before doing that I inserted a 32 gig microSD card so now I have a ton of memory to work with. Setting up wireless with my home network was a snap and using the USB connection to download the updates and apps I want was easy (GPS, Google stuff, etc.). I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T proprietary apps and no AT&T account, no working apps. The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded. I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like. What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working. At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web. So, bottom line: its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great. If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number. It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use. Oh, you need to install ZUNE onto your PC, I'm not particularly impressed with it but its no big deal, I only use it to sync music anyway.",1.0

It was my primary phone until the Lumia 920 came out in November. Since then, I keep my Focus around when I travel out of the country and in situations where I would not want my primary phone to get lost or damaged. My first Focus lasted over 18 months, surviving frequent drops, tosses, pockets with keys, heavy rain and other disasters. This is much better than any cell phone I had used up until that point. I finally managed to crack the screen dropping down some cement steps. I replaced it with an HTC Surround, which barely lasted 4 months under the same conditions. After the HTC phone died, I went and got a new unlocked Focus on Amazon. Though tough, the phone is a finger print magnet. It also feels really cheap and lightweight. For all their cool kit inside, Samsung never produced a phone that looks and feels as expensive as it is. The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today. The AMOLED screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated. The Sound is pretty good. The phone uses NAND memory, which is faster than many SD card based phones. There is an expandable SD card slot (the only Windows Phone 7 device to have one), and the removable battery is a huge plus when traveling. Tinkerers will like the Focus too. That SD card comes in handy, and the unlocked boot loader allows you to flash custom Windows Phone ROMs. You won't be getting Windows Phone 8, but you can flash to 7.8, however. Right now, there are only a few games and apps that require WP8 (Temple Run, Modern Combat 4 are two examples). At $100, this phone is less than half the cost of a budget Lumia 520. The phone is certainly cannot keep up with high end phones today, but it does not feel slow or obsolete like Android phones from 2010.",

I researched the phone to double check it is compatible with AT&T's GoPhone Prepaid program and sure enough it is (AT&T sell this phone in their GoPhone section only at $499). The phone was delivered the day after in good condition and it was sold by BLUTEKUSA. The phone looks new and has no noticeable fingerprints or marks that would indicate it's been used, although the box it came in was obviously opened before. It came with the phone, charger, and a pair of headphones. The Samsung Focus is pretty easy to set up. It asks for date and time as well as a Windows Live ID which can be synced with later if so desired. The screen is beautiful, Super AMOLED making the display rich in brightness and color. There are physical buttons for the Power button, Camera, and Volume Control. It's plastic, so the phone is pretty light, although to the point where one might consider it cheap. The back is a thing plastic case that snaps onto the phone. Taking off the back is a bit on the scary side as I felt I might have snapped it the few times I tried. Overall the phone is a nice build just not one that screams high quality. The Camera takes really good pictures and I was impressed with the 720p video recording as well. Again, not high-end, but it's above average nonetheless. I updated the Samsung Focus to Windows Mango and the software is fantastic. The interface is easy on the eyes and is smooth. I have not seen any hiccups on this phone even though it only comes with 512mb ram, although that seems to be a restriction from Microsoft. To me, it has just as much polish as iOS (the operating system that the iPhone/iPad run) although it lacks a lot of the customization of Android (not really missing it). It integrates Facebook and other social network clients into one area and so far I love it. The keyboard is easy to use as well and have not had any trouble misspelling words. *Edit* Fixed problem with the SIM Card. This phone is excellent. Windows Phones are under appreciated.",10.0

This phone only gives the option of APN, Username, Password, Proxy server and Proxy port. It seems now days you need more options like: MMSC MMS MCC MNC The later phones like the Focus S and Focus 2 might not have these options but another choice is downloading ""Wireless Manager"" app from the Samsung Zone, yet for this model it is not an option. I heard the newer ones had this option but thats up to you to find out I guess. The app suggests you get Network Profile which only gives you the options between ATT and TMOBILE. I guess if you go directly through TMOBILE you will have greater success but the SIM through straight talk will lead to hours of frustration.

Period.,"I've been using the Focus for about three months now and it's honestly by far the best phone I've ever owned. The screen is gorgeous, the WP7 OS is responsive and intuitive, and most of all it actually works as a phone! As a previous dedicated Iphone owner, I can say that I have absolutely no regrets in switching, and I can see the jealousy of my family (who are still Apple nuts) whenever I let them mess around with the interface. The only cons I can put against it are that it only comes with 8 gigs initially (which is just ridiculously low these days), but I stuck another 16 in with an sd card I had lying around. Some people seem to be having an issue with not having their cards work, but I've never had a problem. Also-and this is incredibly minor-there's no gapless playback on the Zune software. I know only about 5 people will actually care (or even notice), but it's slightly irritating at times. In it's current state, I would already put the Focus and WP7 at the cream of the mobile crop, but with the Mango update coming in a week or two, I really can't see any other OS coming near to holding a candle to it. A lot of people are still understandably skeptical due to Microsoft's less than stalwart track record with mobile devices, but WP7 fixes every issue of the past and does what Apple has quit doing-innovating.",82.0

Also, because this phone is single core, it tends to crash a lot and as time goes by, crash incidents increase. It will really start to become aggravating. When a text is sent, sometimes you will have to restart the phone (taking the battery out) only to retype what you wanted to send because the phone cpu locks as you send the message.

Since you mentioned that you already renamed your account, I would recommend that you change your Windows Live ID after 6 months and see if you would encounter any error message. My Response: Wow, that's stupid! Why does it let you change it to begin with? From reading other posts and forums it sounds like this is a big issue. People are changing it not knowing it'll screw up their windows phone. What's the benefit to Microsoft for waiting 6 months to let a Windows Phone owner change their ID back to the previous ID after a screw up? It's not like you guys informed us of this issue. If I've got to wait 6 months to get my phone syncing again, I'm going to drop this Windows Phone for another phone ops at the end of my contract in 4 months.

The only thing that could be better would be the availibility of phone settings. I think this is a limitation of the Windows Phone 7 O.S. On the one hand, since there are few settings, it is easy to set up. On the other hand, since there are few settings, you can not pick and choose when to use your data plan versus your WIFI during a specific action. It is on or off for WIFI, DATA, BLUETOOTH, AIRPLANE MODE. (My old Nokia had the ability to ask which network to use for every connection, which I liked.) While it defaults to WIFI when WIFI is present, it turns off WIFI in sleep mode to conserve battery life. I was kind of shocked to find that I used up 10 MB one night while I was asleep. A quick search finds this as a common complaint. I am on AT&T's Pay-As-You-Go plan, 10 cents per minute and I prepay for data, $5 for 10MB, $10 for 100MB, and $25 for 500MB. What I do is to pay $5.00 per month for the data plan, which rolls over my available data. This works out to about $100 every 6 months or so. There were no problems whatsover getting this phone up and running. It connects nicely with Microsoft's Skydrive. You can enter all of your contacts and calendar entries in Hotmail, and it syncs nicely with your phone, to give you a constant backup.

The apps selection is okay but their interface is quite different from their Droid and Apple counter parts. Yelp for example is bizarre to use when compared to the latest version on Apple or Droid. It uses a Windows phone style interface which has a different screen flow. I don't think 3rd party apps have a good grasp on how to develop for this platform. I will say the app selection is improving though. If you love apps I'd probably skip this phone. If you need a phone for email and Facebook this phone will work very well for you.

Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19.99 (PNY MicroSD) because in the documentation WP7 takes over the SD card for good! The operating system takes up about 1.2 GB so keep that in mind. I love the fact that I can delete the ATT default applications since I am on TMobile pre-paid (50$ unlimited). Yes it is only limited to 2G (edge) speed. Updating the phones software was the only difficulty I had. While updating I got a backup error causing it to not update. I believe it was the front USB port I was using on my computer but at the same time I used a different Micro USB cable from my mytouch and plugged it in a usb port in the back of my computer. Once I did that I was able to apply the 2 updates through the Zune software (required) Anyway, setting up the phone was easy enough.

No, that is not an exaggeration. You see, a few months into ownership, this phone would prompt you to turn it off Randomly, without any contact to the power button. Sometimes while you aren't doing anything. Sometimes while the screen is locked. Reject it/Swiping away cause it to stall. Turning it off results in the same lack of turning on. Sure, you'll be able to turn it on. But it crashes before actually turning on. If you take the battery out, and put it back in, it will immediately start trying to turn on. It should not do this. When you put the battery in normally, it stays off until you power it on. Thus, it stalls again. My guess is your attempts to start it restart after doing this as well, because it seems to take a certain number of trys to get it to run. When its on the charger, the 3 bottom buttons lose functionality. You need those to do just about everything. You can hold the back arrow to access previous things you've been doing, but not while connected. you'll only get a single press. and then you have to wait 5 seconds to get another. Imagine trying to watch Netflix and someone texts you. You can only get that message shortcut if you do it RIGHT THEN. if you don't, you have to the app. but then with the time it takes you to get back to Netflix, you have another text.

Novak,4,"May 14, 2012",True,"Awesome OS, Great Phone, Could Be More Rugged","I'd really been looking forward to an escape from the Android OS and all the problems I had with it in the year since I began using my Samsung SG-I9000. Apple's iPhone was tempting because of its functionality, but it was so overly-hyped and trendy I had many second thoughts about it. I've used an iPhone here and there before and it was simple, but just didn't feel like something I wanted in the long-term. Windows Phone was already on the scene but there were no stores selling them at the time where I live, so after reading review after review, I decided to take a leap of faith and grab the Samsung I917, aka the Focus. The GOOD: First, the operating system is head, shoulders, torso, hips, thighs, knees, calves and ankles above anything else on the market. It's just so simple and intuitive, not to mention beautiful. And unlike Android, it's the exact same from device to device, so the user experience is consistent. Zune integration is beautiful. I can sync all my Zune music on my computer to my phone either by plugging in or over a wi-fi connection. I can also download from the marketplace over the air and then sync back to my computer next time I connect. The People tab is great because it lets me see what all my contacts are doing over social networks all in one place. The phone is also physically beautiful. I especially like the pinstriped back of the case. The device is thin and light and quick (after all, it's basically a first-gen Galaxy S). The BAD: The phone is pretty plasticy, and while it's actually pretty tough, I would really like to see Samsung put out a ""pro"" version made of duraluminum, like their Series 9 laptops are made of. I'm pretty rough on my phones, watches, etc, so I always appreciate rugged versions of products when applicable. The build quality is good but it just doesn't feel overly tough to me, which is the basis of my 4-star rating. The UGLY: Windows Phone marketshare. Seriously, this OS is so amazing, so beautiful, and so simple to use, this should have been 15% - 20% by now in my opinion. Give this phone a chance folks, you'll be glad you did. It's different, it's beautiful, and it's going to be around for a long time.",5.0

I was under the false impression that smart phones were very expensive and the data packages were still $20-25 extra a month. You CAN turn data on this phone OFF (Settings, Cellular, Data Connection) and just use the WI-FI but I chose to have a package that allows me some browsing at only $10 extra a month. This is with T-mobile. This phone does not come with a computer cord, and there is already an update available for it, so I strongly recommend purchasing a USB cable for it so you can update immediately. WITHOUT THE UPDATE, YOU CAN'T ACCESS APPS. The updates are free. I also could not get picture messages without downloading the app called Network Profile which is also a free app. Now that the apps and picture messages are working, I can safely say it is a very nice phone. After the update you can also voice text, which is the only thing I wished this phone had prior to me downloading the update. Now it does. This is a Windows operating system which means only Windows apps are available. You can't get Instagram, Snapchat, or a lot of other popular ones. When an app is created it's almost always made for Apple or Android products first, and Blackberry and Windows devices later, if at all. So that kind of sucks. The price on this phone tends to fluctuate. I paid $135 and a week later my sister paid $98.",5.0

I got my phone, and learned it was not unlocked; however, if a person were to do a simple google search, there are many instructions on how to do this very easily! To give a product 1 star just because it didn't come unlocked seems very unreasonable. The phone itself is great. I have no contract currently, but using existing wifi I am able to download apps, music, games, and many more things. I only removed one star because it did not come unlocked but I do not feel it should be a score of 1 star. I was able to unlock the phone myself, but I will not give out the instructions, like I said, google is your friend. The phone is responsive and sleek. The plastic is a little cheap, but not by much. The screen can be wiped of finger prints easily. I am going to be getting a screen protector and a case for this phone later on. A lot of the windows games that play on this phone seem to do okay. Some of the real knew games lag a bit but I feel it is still good quality. Because this phone is refurbished, I thought I would get it with some scratches or blemishes. This is not so.

I did some online checking but was unable to determine if cell-to-ear volume was a specific model weakness. Three points from my ordering experience: 1) check the vendor's return policy before purchasing; 2) when you receive the order check the phone properties first--it's easy to become enchanted with smartphones to the point of overlooking the basic on ear use; 3) buyers should reflect on the liklihood that any unlocked cell listed is actually new. To date I've found my second phone to be sleek, with the Windows 7 system impressive. Apps are increasingly available and diverse, not the walled garden of Iphone. Of contacting Samsung: dealing with customer support (Samsung or any other) be aware you likely will interact with a rep--working from a script--who has no cellular expertise. Check the manual carefully before entering the customer service ordeal. You'll be directed through two corrections, soft reset, and if the problem remains, hard reset. (You can find both on any model via web search). If these two corrections fail you're at the point of sending the phone in for repair or returning to seller. If you do need to contact Samsung, I found Facebook easier than web site contact. Twitter is also an option. Sept. 2016 update: I'm getting ready to upgrade from the i917.

I went out the other night and took some pics outside in the pitch black, I couldnt see what I was aiming at until the flash went off, but the pics were really good. Today we went to the beach as there was a big storm and we took pics side by side and the focus produced much better pics than my nexus one. There are a few things that I like better about android for sure. Live wallpapers for one, and the stupid colored tiles on windows.

All I Can Say Is Wow.,"This phone, coming from a previous Samsung phone user, is absolutely amazing. I have never had or even played with a phone this stellar. Previously I have had a blackberry, a galaxy and a gravity. There are many well created things that go along with this phone but at the same time, there are a few downsides. Here's a pros cons list to help out... Pros * Very nice screen, surpasses any other touch-screen I've used * Very easy to learn the functions included * A lot of customization options included in interface * Uses standard Micro-USB charger * Has X-Box live capabilities * A generous sized screen * Can use internet over WI-FI * Zune music and video Cons * Battery can sometimes only last for 24 hours * If on T-Mobile or other carrier besides AT&T cannot send or receive pictures * Low quality camera Another heads up would be that if you want to sign into your current X-Box live account, make sure to use the e-mail linked to that account or else it will set u up with an automatic account and you cant change it unless you proceed with a master reset :( i made that mistake when i first got the phone. Anyways overall, I would say that this phone is a 9/10 for battery use and X-Box live. I would HIGHLY recommend this phone if you are between two different ones.",2.0

I popped in my T-Mobile SIM card and the phone was good to go. I think my phone came with a defective battery: it takes over four hours to charge. I'm looking to get that replaced. The AMOLED screen is amazing. The system is fast, responsive, and looks great. It's programmed in C#, if you're into that sort of thing :-). But I'll skip all the awesome stuff that you've already read about. Let me mention a few of the current downsides. * You must use Microsoft's Zune software to manage music. I prefer mp3 players which act like USB drives. I.e. you plug them in and your filesystem browser displays the contents as regular folders and files. This Windows Phone doesn't work this way. There is apparently some registry hack to work around this, but it would be nice if Microsoft supported this out of the box. * No sleep timer - There are a couple of free ones on the marketplace, but they aren't ideal. * No FLAC support * No OGG support * T-Mobile users: Sending pictures in texts doesn't seem to work. * T-Mobile users: Seems like the data speed is limited to 2G. I don't have a high-end data plan so I'm not so concerned about this. The Wi-Fi speeds are great of course. UPDATE 2011-12-14 * I got picture texts to work by installing the Samsung Network Profile app and selecting 'T-Mobile' in it's configuration.",7.0

Much better than the iPhone, HTC and Motorola displays. It truly is amazing and works good in all conditions including outdoors. The Samsung Captivate (android phone) also has the same screen. If fact, Samsung is now switching all their future phones to use AMOLED. SOUND: The Speaker and call quality is very good. I have used a lot of phones and I can tell you this is the best yet. The speaker phone sounds just as good as a full size home phone. Compared to my daughters new iPod, the Focus speaker is way better, and she even admitted it. SPEED: Windows Phone 7 powered by the snapdragon 1GH processor is very fast. No lag, no screen delay, no issue flicking and scrolling. Fast internet browser as well. FEATURES: I am very impressed how polished Windows Phone 7 is, and I think its going to get better. Microsoft is putting a great deal of money into it and consumers get the reward. The Windows Phone 7 live tiles are so much better than old school icons on most other phones. SUMMARY: This phone is truly ahead of its time. There are people that will say the iPhone or Android is better, but that is only bias because they probably have never used this phone and compared the features I mentioned above. I am also looking forward to the WP7 mango update that has 500+ more features. This phone is amazing. - UPDATE 11/22. Running latest windows phone 7.5 mango update. Works great. A lot more high quality apps are now available. My wife got the same phone for free at ATT with 2 year contract.

The phones were speedily shipped and came fully boxed and packaged and SIM unlocked. Windows Phone 7 is a joy to use - slicker and more elegant than either Android or Blackberry phones. I like it more than Apple phones as well. The handset and the interface both feel modern and high tech and a very easy to use. And the text on the phone is big - which makes it much easier to read than any other phone. Everyone who has seen it wants one. Two things you need to know. The phone has an AT&T logo - which is a bit of a surprise when you first turn on the phone. And there is some bundled AT&T software that takes 30 seconds to uninstall. So this is more of a very minor one off solvable issue than anything. The second is that the phone operating system needs to be upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 7.5 (Mango). This requires downloading and installing Microsoft Zune on your computer, hooking your phone to your computer, and checking for upgrades. The upgrade process also takes 30-40 minutes. This is a bit of a hassle. But still worth it overall. I am very happy with this Samsung Focus phone and Windows Phone 7.",7.0

I was able to purchase this phone without contract for the same price as purchasing a new iPhone 4S from ATT and extending my contract. I just popped my SIM card in and I was good to go--my grandfathered-in unlimited 3G iphone plan worked perfectly. The device itself is great. The construction is mainly hard plastic--which versus the iPhone's glass and metal, initially felt cheap to me, but its holding up well even after taking a few spills and SO much lighter than the iPhone. Nice curved edges and a slight taper from the top to bottom are nice design touches and make the device really nice to hold. The 5MP camera takes great pictures (flash works suprisingly well) and the 720p video is great. The 4 inch AMOLED screen is almost unbelieveable sharp and the colors are incredibly vibrant. If you have never seen an OLED screen, you will be suprised at how nice it looks. The OS is where this phone really shines. Yes, the appstore is lacking a lot of the popular apps that I loved on the iPhone, but it is getting better. The OS is super responsive, scrolling is super smooth, animations are consistent, pinch-to-zoom is just as good as the iPhone (and much better than the Android devices I've used). The Zune media player is great (even has an FM radio) and I find the interface to be much more intuitive than the iPhone. For this price, you'd be hard to find a better unlocked phone.",

For those of you who don't have a data plan, and don't plan on getting one for the future, the WiFi is a really nice touch because it allows you to browse the internet without being forced in a 2-year contract. Most of the phone that have wifi are smartphone, which carriers are requiring a data plan with, but this phone is a feature phone. wifi is a great ""feature"" on a ""dumbphone"". The only problem I have with this phone is the annoying QWERTY keypad while texting. The keys are really small, and I frequently press the ""back"" key instead of the ""backspace"" key. I'm getting used to it though, and it's also helpful that this phone has a feature that is similar to android's ""swype"", where you slide your finger across the keyboard to type. the internet browser is good, and the phone supports youtube videos. the quality isn't the greatest for videos that have a lot of action, but for the occasional stand-up comedian video, this phone performs sufficiently. the phone sports a micro sd card slot, so I can load all my music on the card and play it on the phone. I have at&t in the us, and the phone started working immediately after i put the sim card in it. the batter life is above average, but it doesn't blow you away. overall, i'm very happy with this phone.",23.0

This one not only developed similar problems in about half a year (battery life shortened greatly -- new battery didn't help) but added another problem (cracked external screen) and exaggerated another (external buttons too easily activated.) The screen crack was caused by sharing a pocket with keys and it may just be luck that the first one didn't crack from the same reason. The external buttons are too easily activated (including the ""lock-unlock external keys"" one)and this results in excessive use of battery and unintended annoying sounds/messages. The protective case I bought didn't help this much. I need just a basic phone with GOOD durability and resistance to various forms of minor abuse. I can't do the physical work I do well if I have to pay frequent and careful attention to babying a phone. It goes in a front pocket and is sometimes accompanied by other hard items -- usually keys.

We needed the PTT (push to talk) service which limited our options. The original purchase was in April 2012. I waited to place this review until I could truly see how these phones worked. Every single employee that has one of these phones has complained about it. The ""durablility"" of this phone is inaccurate. Many of the our phones have the ""thumb print"" discoloration on the outside screen as I see others have had as well. This is just an annoyance and did not hinder the use of the phone unless using the PTT service, which of course is what our guys use 90% of the time. When using the PTT it is difficult to understand the person speaking at times. The alert sound for PTT is also very low and cannot be set for volume AND vibrate. This is a negative when someone is running machinery and cannot hear their phone. Even if it is in their pocket or cliped on their belt, it doesn't vibrate for them to be aware of the call. I have had several phones with speaker problems. People not being able to hear one person at all, yet that person can hear others fine. The joint is sturdy, so far only a couple have had issues with them. Only one in which the phone came apart. There have been battery issues as well. The manufactuer did not have replacements even while the phones were still under warranty. I had to wait for over six months for a replacement battery for one phone. Samsung did not supply any to Verizon nor did they have any in stock. When one finally was available, I had to get it directly from Samsung who said that if there was damage on the one being returned we would have to pay for it. This was poor customer service. I will give the representatives at Verizon a good review though. Every rep that I spoke with did a great job trying to solve the issues. It is with the phone. We will be replacing these phones as needed with a better PTT phone. This is definately not ""military"" quality.",3.0

I didn't realize a flash player and flashlight would tax the other features the Convoy1 had(such as the internal memory,music player and the sturdy flip hinge). The more I used the Convoy2, the more I hated it. 1. The first thing I noticed was the weak flip hinge. If you pick up a Convoy2 carelessly the phone falls open. The Convoy stays closed no matter how you pick it up. 2. The internal memory is pathetic. I kept getting memory alerts on accepting text or pic messages; ""insufficient memory cannot load music""; ""delete files""; etc. There was a 16GB micro card in it,too. The Convoy has great memory without a micro card. 3. You would think that files and data on a micro sd card would transfer from phone A1 to phone A2, correct? NO THEY DON""T! The Convoy2 couldn't detect any photos, pics or ringtones on the card at all. The Convoy read pics and music on a micro card from my LG Swift. Not even the same maker. How about that?

I selected the phone because it was advertised as ""built to strict military specs to resist almost anything you can throw at it - shock, extreme temperatures, dust, humidity and more."" A little over a month after I bought it, I pulled it out of my pocket to discover that the outside screen was displaying a yellow-orange blob, making most of the display unreadable. Samsung customer support told me to send the phone in for warranty repair, which I did. Two weeks later I received an email from Samsung customer support claiming the phone is ""Out of Warranty"" and I would need to pay Samsung three times what I paid for it to have the phone repaired. The Samsung customer service rep told me that the advertisement on samsung.com was really a third party, and these claims they are making don't apply to the whole phone, as the advertisement says. The warranty doesn't cover anything that happens to the phone (anything you can throw at it - shock, extreme temperatures, dust, humidity and more). In other words, even under normal usage, Samsung is unwilling to honor its one year warranty. Besides the poor reliability, it has some annoying design flaws. The phone doesn't allow you to immediately lock the external keys automatically, so I've sent a few annoying pocket texts and have the phone continuously beeping in my pocket because they don't lock out right away. The texting is kind of jumpy - the response time for hitting some keys is slower than for others keys. Mildly annoying. The calendar erase functions are poorly designed such that you don't know if you are erasing all the events on a particular day or for all days. I accidentally blew away all my appointments because of this design flaw. There are better choices out there. Avoid this phone.",4.0

The alarm clock fails at least one in every every 5 times it comes around. The battery is fairly reliable. Anyone who liked the Convoy-1 should not expect the same from the Convoy-2. Samsung had a winner for the working person but turned it into a wimp. I hate saying this because I loved my Convoy-1... and am very disappointed in the Convoy-2.

This is my first Android phone ever so I am still learning all the tricks, but it has a rather easy interface to learn which is nice considering all the other phones I have used. Voice dialing works great without training which is suprising since I have a very strong Oklahoma accent. The screen looks great for a $99 smartphone. Some reviewers forget that most mobile providers subsidize their prices, so the price they paid does not reflect the cost of Hi-Def screens. I have not tried any apps out other than what was included with the phone, but this device was suprisingly free of bloatware. The music player sounds rather good with headphones, which is suprising with very few controls. The camera is great for outdoors or very bright indoor areas, but low light levels tend to wash out all the bright colors. All in all, I have to say that the Samsung Replenish is a great value for the first time Android user. Update After having this phone for a few months, I have nothing to detract from above. In fact this phone is much sturdier than I expected. I accidentally dropped this phone into a shallow puddle in my parking lot while it was raining, and I thought I might have ruined it. But after carefuly drying it, it worked like it always had and no moistier worked its way into the screen.

I have Documents to Go installed which I use to edit Excel spreadsheets while on the bus or train. And it works great for that. I have Dolphin HD browser installed and web surfing works good. Not quite as fast as my spouses' Epic 4g but it did not cost nearly as much either. I also use to update Facebook occasionally, watch YouTube videos, play a few games (angry birds, totemo, and age of conquest) currently. Email and Words with Friends and I use Google Play for music and have a bunch of music on my SD card. I noticed when I updated Google Play and YouTube and a few other things the phone started to lock up and touch screen was reacting very slowly. I uninstalled those updates and everything is working just fine again. -The screen is not the greatest. A lot of pixelation. If you are a heavy video watcher you should not get this phone. -The keyboard is great. I do a lot of entering of data and seller listings on my phone so I prefer a keyboard to a touch screen keyboard. You lose some screen size but when you are using the touch screen keyboard on phones without a keyboard you lose even more screen size. -The battery is about average for a Android phone. You need to shut wifi, bluetooth, syncing and GPS when you are not using them. There is a great widget that puts big buttons on your home page so you can turn these on and off quickly. Dolphin Battery Manager works well for me too. -Internal space on phone. There is not much internal space on the phone and most apps don't let you install to the SD card. I can have between 5-10 apps installed at a time on the phone no problem. I keep some on my SD card and uninstall ones I am not using if I want to use a app that I don't have installed due to space constraints. It takes about 30 seconds to do. Not that big of a deal. Bottom line for the price it's a great phone. Its a great introduction to Android phones for a smart phone beginner.

Also I accidentally locked myself out within an hr of owning but thankfully boost customer service was very compliant and helpful, once I got past their automotive voice mail (getting a phone rep can be a pain).

Recently, my Galaxy's charger socket became inoperable, and I had to send the phone in for repair so it could accept a charge. I decided to buy the Samsung Replenish as a temporary replacement. I thought I was going to like this phone, because of the adequate screen size, the QWERTY keyboard buttons on the front, and longer battery life than the Galaxy Prevail. Wrong, Wrong, Wrong. -- The buttons are too small to even peck out a simple text message. -- There is NO onscreen keyboard that appears to type in any fields. [YOU HAVE to use the microscopic buttons below (unless you download a keyboard / scratch pad from the Google play store)]. -- The overall design is too bulky and cumbersome to carry around. -- The computing power lead me to pull over on the side of the road, because the GPS / computer is not able to keep up with driving / turn-by-turn directions to a destination. (This phone belongs in the mid-late 1990s when cell phones were starting to become popular) The Samsung Replenish is unusually sluggish, lacks computing power, and is slow to respond to the most simple of commands and tasks. When you need to hang up a call, the phone takes longer than usual for the screen to appear (after the power button is pressed), for the phone to ""slide"" and ""hang up"" a call. $99 is a great deal - that is - if your fingers are small enough to control the buttons, and you have enough time to wait on the side of the road for your phone's computer to catch up to the GPS. Or maybe I should just move slower, to catch up to the phone itself.",2.0

But I already knew that when i bought it. But the title was deceptive. The phone came unlocked and I bought to for my Straighttalk plan. The At&T sim card (normal sized) fit easily and I was up and ready to go in a few minutes and I have a 4G connection on this. The phone is very slim, feels nice in your hand but is a bit slippery (hence the loss of one star). I suggest buying a case for the phone. Otherwise everything was better than I expected. The AMOLED display (similar to the retina display) is just bloody awesome. I believe the phone has a 1.4 Ghz processor and the videos and games play real smooth. The phone does not heat up much either. Windows 7.5 Mango which is preinstalled has great apps on the web and is very easy and intuitive to navigate. I am waiting for the 7.8 update that samsung has promised to release for this model. The touch screen is really sensitive to touch and your navigation between panes is very easy too. I just love this phone. Have not regretted it. Suggest getting a windows live account to use the Skydrive that automatically updates your files. The most important feature is the preinstalled version of microsoft office and the availability of office 360 on it and your files sync automatically between your PC and your phone through skydrive (how cool is that). Just great. Also, you can connect to XBOX live online and play games. All this for a fraction of the cost of an iphone is just awesome. The phone has two cameras front facing (for skype) and rear facing. The pictures are pretty good and there is a software to auto-fix your pics if you want to. Overall I am really impressed with the phone. Though there was something strange about the battery. It used to last for less than a day when I bought the phone. But once it got completely discharged and after recharging it, it now lasts for over 1.5 days on a single charge with normal browsing and a couple of calls a day.

But the most annoying part was that the phone would not be seen by my computer and the Zune software so that it would sync the phone and be able to download my music and photos, etc. I contacted the seller MangoWireless after they had emailed me seeking a positive feed back on Amazon. Well I got a couple of replies about how they care about my satisfaction and how they would help resolve any problems.... HaHa what a joke they finally responded saying that I had to deal with Amazon fulfillment for my problem. After much time spent online I found the solution myself. It was an easy fix, so now my phone and computer are talking (syncing) and working properly. I got all the new updates to my phones programming, and loaded my music. Now this phone works WONDERFULLY.

Pros: 1. Better pixel density than focus. 2. Faster 1.4 Ghz processor. 3. Is capable of 4G. 5. Is latest generation of Windows phone. 6. Front facing camera for skype or video chat or video call 7.

Smaller screen than samsung focus(3.7 vs 4 inches) So This is an excellent phone for the price.Just go for it. For its specs the phone should be sold for a price range of $250+. Update :12 August 2012 After using phone for like 4 months I have following things to say: 1. I havent faced a single phone freeze after the recent tango update(there is way to trick phone to update even though AT&T doesnt push it) 2. The app center is growing rapidly(In last few months as I myself have seen). There are a lots of apps tailored for your need. 3. Games works great on this device no freezing and lagging. 4.

This means you can't enable internet sharing on the phone until you visit / contact AT&T :-( Otherwise, still a great buy. -- Original Review -- The phone - 1) Mine came with Windows 7.10, updated itself to 7.5 with no trouble at all. 2) The model I received was branded AT&T but was completely unlocked. 3) Screen is bright indoors, not highly visible in direct or strong sunlight 4) Audio is crisp and clear, call quality excellent Things it does well - 1) Multiple email accounts! You can have more than one Exchange server account, multiple POP / IMAP accounts no problem. My old phone (Nokai e63) didn't support multiple exchange server accounts so this was a major item for me. 2) Multi-calendar support! If you setup multiple accounts (Exchange, Hotmail, Google) the phone will sync your various calenders and color code each calender's items as they show up on the phone's calender. (VERY useful for me) 3) Wifi works every time 4) Market place - Not as many apps as Android or iPhone, but certainly a good selection nevertheless. 5) Skype! 6) Dual cameras, useful for item 5 above, although the cam doesn't come on automatically, you have to enable it every time. Things it doesn't do well - 1) NO VPN support! Hopefully to be there in a future update :-( 2) Custom ring tones - Really frustrating, you have to limit your ring tones to 40sec, the file has to be less than 1MB AND you must specify 'ringtone' as the genre for it to work. A little too much effort... 3) Custom alert tones - Non-existent. You can't set a custom mp3 / wma file as your text alert or alarm tone. *rage* 4) Can't copy items between calenders. *sigh* 5) Switching between Wifi and Cellular data sometimes doesn't happen, you end up having to power cycle to re-connect to the cellular net after you turn off the wifi End Result - Perfect phone if you need to manage multiple email accounts and calenders, really fast and responsive and generally a joy to use. Skype with cam support is great if your connection is fast enough to use it.",10.0

The camera is also pretty good, though not as good as the aforementioned model of the Focus. Internet connectivity on wifi and through data plan is fast enough for her purposes. Battery life is also not too bad and is able to last the whole day, 7 am - 5 pm, with wifi and data internet connectivity turned off. The only issue she is having is with some of the limits it has. For example; there arent as many apps in the app store, and a vast majority of them look weird or are not as optimized or refined as those for other Mobile O.S's. She is constantly complaining about the facebook app. Another thing is the fact that it cannot connect to other bluetooth devices for some reason.

The Focus Flash phone is truly unlocked despite what some of the other reviewers stated. I believe the problem those reviewers are having is enabling it adequately to access the internet using another service. I had problems accessing the internet as well initially. It took me a couple of days (and no help from Straight Talk, Samsung and AT&T and a little help (tiny) from this phone's seller) before I figured out how to enter the Straight Talk APN settings onto the Flash properly so that I could access the internet. The Focus Flash has APN entries for user name and password which threw me off for awhile. Also the proxy URL entry on the Focus Flash needed the IP address entry provided by Straight Talk and did not use the web address entry provided by Straight Talk. One leaves the password entry blank on the Focus Flash which is counter intuitive. Once I sorted this all out, I was able to access the internet just fine on the Focus Flash. The first thing I noticed is that Windows phones have very few of the Android apps or any good apps for that matter. I do think the Windows UI is nice but the lack of good apps is frustrating. This phone has a smallish screen especially in comparison to the Note 2. This is an adequate backup phone if one has the need for one which I do since I am using T-Mobile on my Note 2 for it's unlimited data. Straight Talk (using the ATT sim card) has superior coverage in the hinterlands which I drive through daily; it is unfortunate that the Straight Talk fine print in their terms of use say it is forbidden to use their unlimited internet service to stream videos or use any other program that uses too much data. It is my understanding that Simple Mobile controls data usage less explicitly per there terms of service but they do cut you off after about 2G per month. It seems like the only unlimited data is T-Mobile hence my need for a second phone with Straight Talk's ATT sim card service since I drive through the country frequently to get to work and other places that I frequent.",

I also have problems making calls when trying to dial to make calls the screen blinks like a christmas light and when the call connects the person cannot hear me. I wish i could say i am pleased but i am not. I am a busy business woman in need of a reliable phone. I would like you to fix this problem or replace the phone. Otherwise please refund my money. Im truly was excited to get this phone but with these issues im not excited as you can imagine.",

Surprised my husband n Bought this phone for his Christmas present n had to send it back. He has T mobile and they said they didn't even know Samsung had a windows phone lol. We went to the store to see if there was something they could do to update the phone so we could do pic msgs. But other than that the phone was ok. The funny thing to me is my husband is an electronics fanatic n this phone was hard for him to understand although he picked it. I told him I bet he didn't know this phone would give him a beating lol.,
